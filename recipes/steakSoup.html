    <p>You'll love this easy Steak Soup (Vegetable Beef Soup) recipe! Quick and easy meal to make, and delicious!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. sirloin steak, or beef stew meat (or whatever lean steaks are on sale!), cut into about 1â€³ cubes</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup carrots, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 lb. potatoes (choose your favorite - Russett, Yukon, red, etc.), diced and peeled (optional)</li>
        <li>8 cups low-sodium beef stock (or more if you like lots of broth)</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 (28 oz.) can diced tomatoes, with juice</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. Italian seasonings</li>
        <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp. seasoned salt (yep!!)</li>
        <li>lots of freshly-ground black pepper</li>
        <li>salt to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><p>In a large pot, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-high heat. Add half the steak and cook, stirring frequently, until well browned, 
             about 2 minutes. Remove the steak with a slotted spoon. Repeat with another tablespoon of oil and the remaining steak, and remove the steak 
             similarly once it is cooked.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pot. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes. 
             Add the carrots, celery and potatoes, and continue sauteing for another 3 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Add the next seven ingredients (beef stock through seasoned salt) and the cooked steak to the pot, and stir to combine. 
             Bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pot with a spoon to dislodge any brown bits from cooking the steak. 
             Reduce the heat, cover pot, and simmer for 1-2 hours (the more the merrier - especially for tenderizing the meat and seasoning the broth).
             Just before serving, season with salt and lots of freshly-ground black pepper. Then serve.</p>
