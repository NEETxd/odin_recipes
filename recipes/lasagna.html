    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/Lasagna.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p>

    <p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
      <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Put pasta water on to boil</li>
      <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
      <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
      <li>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</li>
      <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>Heat the oven to 375Â°F</li>
      <li>Assemble the lasagna</li>
      <li>Bake</li>
      <li>Cool and serve</li>
    </ol>
